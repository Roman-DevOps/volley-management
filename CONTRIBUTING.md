This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](https://bitbucket.org/VolleyManagement/volleymanagement/src/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [Sergii Diachenko](https://bitbucket.org/sdiachen/).

## How to reach team and/or ask question? ##

First of all check out [Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/VolleyManagement/volleymanagement/wiki/Home) to get some basic information.

Note: :warning: Some articles in requirements section might not be up to date. It is hard to keep it up to date :(. There are couple of ideas to use some kind of live documentation tool. As for now look at unit tests to see actual requirements.

We have Slack chat [volleymanagement.slack.com](https://volleymanagement.slack.com/). As the project is relatively small all questions can be asked in `#general` channel

As for now to get access to this chat please write email to [Sergii Diachenko](https://bitbucket.org/sdiachen/). In future we might get this automated.

You can do so by creating pull request into `master` branch. After review your request will either be merged or set of questions/suggestions will be given to you to address before accepting PR.
### Visual Studio online task tracker ###
As this project has been mainly contributed by group of students learning .NET web development majority of the functional features is kept in Visual Studio Online. As it provides better workflow for student group working on the project every day.

Having said that OSS contributions is better managed by Bitbucket cloud issue tracker. Thus this is the recommended place to log new issues.

At some point in the future we will have single consolidated backlog.

If you want to see issues stored in VS Online please contact [Sergii Diachenko](https://bitbucket.org/sdiachen/) for access.

## Development Environment ##

* .NET 4.7
* VS 2017 any edition
* SQL Server 2008-2016 (2016 LocalDB is default but you can change connection string)

All dependencies are managed via NuGet so you don't need to take any additional steps to acquire dependencies.

Project uses integration with several external systems:
* Google OAuth provider
* Re-captcha
* Gmail and/or SendGrid
In order to test/debug/use features using those integrations you might need to create appropriate profiles at following providers and use secrets provided in order to run system.

üöß ToDo: Provide short guide on how to accomplish that.
