## How to reach team and/or ask question?

First of all check out [Wiki](https://github.com/VolleyManagement/volley-management/wiki) to get some basic information.

Note: :warning: Some articles in requirements section might not be up to date. It is hard to keep it up to date :(. There are couple of ideas to use some kind of live documentation tool. As for now look at unit tests to see actual requirements.

We have Slack chat [volleymanagement.slack.com](https://volleymanagement.slack.com/). As the project is relatively small all questions can be asked in `#general` channel

As for now to get access to this chat please write email to Sergii Diachenko(mailto:sdiachenko AT outlook DOT com). In future we might get this automated.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

### Branch naming

Project has a CI configured to work with following branch naming pattern:

**issue_#{issue number}_short_issue_description_with_underscores**

### Pull Requests

If you want to directly contribute to the project you are highly welcome!

You can do so by creating pull request into `master` branch. After review your request will either be merged or set of questions/suggestions will be given to you to address before accepting PR.

As part of PR approval process project uses CI checks. Please following branch naming so it can be picked up by CI and properly verified.

### Visual Studio online task tracker

As this project has been mainly contributed by group of students learning .NET web development majority of the functional features is kept in Visual Studio Online. As it provides better workflow for student group working on the project every day.

Having said that OSS contributions is better managed by Bitbucket cloud issue tracker. Thus this is the recommended place to log new issues.

At some point in the future we will have single consolidated backlog.

If you want to see issues stored in VS Online please contact Sergii Diachenko(mailto:sdiachenko AT outlook DOT com) for access.

## Development Environment

Minimum sofware requirements:

* .NET 4.7
* VS 2017 any edition
* SQL Server 2008-2016 (2016 LocalDB is default but you can change connection string)

All dependencies are managed via NuGet so you don't need to take any additional steps to acquire dependencies.

Project uses integration with several external systems:

* Google OAuth provider
* Re-captcha
* Gmail and/or SendGrid

In order to test/debug/use features using those integrations you might need to create appropriate profiles at following providers and use secrets provided in order to run system.

üöß ToDo: Provide short guide on how to accomplish that.

## Styleguides
